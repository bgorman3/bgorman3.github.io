    <section id="How">
        <h2>How It All Started?</h2>
       <p>At the age of 13, observing my brother's transition from our childhood Xbox to his first personal computer fascinated me. Eager to have a more personal computing experience, I was determined to move away from using the household PC. While the exact process of how my brother built his PC eludes my memory, I yearned to emulate him. I convinced my parents to hand down his old parts when he upgraded, hoping to follow in his footsteps.</p>

        <h2>Who Got You Into It?</h2>
       <p>At the age of 13, observing my brother's transition from our childhood Xbox to his first personal computer fascinated me. Eager to have a more personal computing experience, I was determined to move away from using the household PC.

    <section id="When">
        <h2>When Did You Start?</h2>
     <p>My journey commenced when my brother upgraded his PC at 17, and being four years younger, I was 13 at the time. Witnessing the joy and camaraderie he experienced with friends while gaming incited jealousy in me, prompting a desire to have my own PC. Although I didn't delve into learning the specifics of building PCs until my sophomore year in high school, it was a computer engineering class that introduced me to the process. Years later, armed with that experience, I ventured into buying new parts for my PC. </p>

    <section id="Why">
        <h2>Why Did You Do It?</h2>
        <p>Primarily driven by envy and a longstanding desire kindled by observing my brother, I yearned to craft my own PC. The longing to learn the art of PC building, nurtured over years of observation, finally materialized when my boredom intersected with a culmination of accumulated knowledge from classes and online tutorials. </p>
