    <section id="How">
        <h2>How It All Started?</h2>
       <p>My fascination with PC building began during my teenage years when I embarked on a quest to understand how computers functioned. Eager to delve deeper into technology, I started exploring the intricacies of hardware and the art of building a PC from scratch. It all began with assembling a basic rig, armed with online tutorials, manuals, and a strong sense of curiosity. The process of slotting in components, connecting wires, and witnessing the system come to life felt nothing short of magical. Over time, this curiosity evolved into a passion for understanding the latest advancements in the field and experimenting with unique configurations and customizations. The journey from a novice enthusiast to a seasoned builder has been a remarkable learning experience, driving my ongoing love affair with the ever-evolving world of PC hardware.</p>

    <section id="Who">
        <h2>Who Got You Into It?</h2>
       <p>When I was 13 I saw how my brother was super into getting his  first PC and how he transitioned from using the Xbox we had as kids to now having his own computer. This facinated me because I didn't have a phone yet so I was eager to finally stop using the house PC and upgrade to something more personal. After that I don't exactly remember how my brother built his own PC but I wanted to copy him so I begged my parents to give  me his old  parts when he upgraded. </p>

    <section id="When">
        <h2>When Did You Start?</h2>
     <p>I started when my brother finally upgraded from his old PC when he was 17 and I am 4 years younger so I was 13 and after watching him has so much fun with friends I was jealous so I wanted to get in on the action and finally start playing on my own PC. I didn't start learning how to actually build PC's until I was at least a sophomore in highschool. I took a computer engineering class and one of the projects was a  guide on building your own PC. I took my experience and bought new parts for my PC years later. </p>

    <section id="Why">
        <h2>Why Did You Do It?</h2>
        <p>I was mostly jealous of my brother and I had wanted to learn how to build my own PC for years after watching him so one day I got bored enough and armed with my knowledge of how to build from classes and Youtube  tutorials I finally went for it. </p>
