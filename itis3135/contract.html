    <p> I, Brendan Gorman agree to abide by the terms in my Fall 2023 ITIS3135 Web App Design and Development with my instructor, D.I. von Briesen.

        I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly available to the world. I will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
