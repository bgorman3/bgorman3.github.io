        <h2>My "First" PC</h2>
        <p>The first family PC we had was a Lenovo ThinkCentre M81. It had an SFF form factor, Intel Core i5-2400 @ 3.10 GHz, 8GB DDR3 RAM, NEW 500GB SSD, DVD-RW, Wi-Fi, VGA to HDMI Adapter, and a NEW Keyboard + Mouse. It operated without an OS.</p>

    <p>Overall, it was a great first PC. It supported multiple monitors and could handle running some games. Unfortunately, I don't have any pictures I took myself as we disposed of this PC years ago.</p>









    <section id="Second">
        <h2>My First PC I Built Myself</h2>
        <p>At the age of 13, with assistance from my brother and using his old parts, I assembled my own gaming PC. It was capable of running less intensive games like Fortnite and Minecraft. Unfortunately, I have only two picturesâ€”one when I relocated my PC to the living room and another showcasing my PC setup.</p>

        </div>
      
    </div>

    <p>Overall, this PC didn't last long due to my changing preferences during that phase of life. Over the past few years, I consistently upgraded with newer hardware. Regrettably, the components still remain in our house, now aging and deteriorating, which is rather disheartening.</p>



    <section id="Final">
        <h2>My Current PC</h2>
        <p>Upon checking my motherboard's BIOS, I realized my PC is now 4 years old. It seems like it's time for an upgrade as my RX580 struggles to keep up with current AAA games. I received the upgraded PC as a Christmas gift and it has been a reliable companion since then.</p>

    <p>Overall, my PC holds a special place for me, and I don't plan on replacing it unless necessary (or until I find a compelling reason to do so, lol). Personally, I consider this PC build as my favorite among all the ones I've assembled in the past.</p>
