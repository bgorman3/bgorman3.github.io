    <p>Overall it was a great frist PC it had support for more than one monitor and it actually could run some games. I don't have any pictures that I took myself sadly because we threw this PC away years ago. </p>










    <section id="Second">
        <h2>My First PC I Built Myself</h2>
       <p>When I was 13 I finally got my help from my brother combined with his old parts to build my own gaming PC. This bad boy could run any game that wasn't somewhat intensive. I mostly used it for  Fortnite and Minecraft of course. I only have two pictures one was when I was forced to move my pc in the living room and another was of my PC set up.  </p>

    </div>

    <p>Overall this PC didn't last too long because I was the age where I wasn't satisfied with anything I had so with aging hardware I went and upgraded over the past few years. The pieces still sit in our house today rusting away which is kinda sad. 
    </p>


    <section id="Final">
        <h2>My Current PC</h2>
     <p>I recently checked the BIOS on my motherboard and realized that my PC is now 4 years old and I think that its finally time for an upgrade because I can't even run triple A games anymore because my poor RX580 cannot keep up anymore. I got my PC after upgrading it for christmas and I never looked back.  </p>

    <p>Overall my PC is my baby and ill never let anything replace it until I get a reason too lol. I personally think that this PC build is my favorite out of all of the ones i've done in  the past.</p>
