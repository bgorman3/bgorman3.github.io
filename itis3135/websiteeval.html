        <h2>Good Website</h2>
        <section>
            <h3><a href="https://www.svz.io/">svz.io</a></h3>
            <p>SVZ is a company that does webflow development, as you can tell. They have one of the best-designed websites I've seen.  </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast: Every single color they use is simple: black and white, black, yellow, and green. Black goes well with any color on the webpage; there isn't a single color that doesn't fit.</li>
                <li>Repetition: Every element and font are the same, and it fits well at any resolution, whether it's on mobile or scrunched. The website fits so well.</li>
                <li>Alignment: The structure of the page is arguably its strongest point. Everything is in a grid, and your eyes slowly follow the page down, reading box by box.</li>
                <li>Proximity: The elements that are related are always right next to each other, and it's super easy to read because everything fits.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This website follows every crap element perfectly, and you can see why they work in web development. It's hard to be a web development company with a poor-looking website. </p>

        <h2>Crappy Website</h2>
        <section>
            <h3><a href="https://www.zara.com/us/">zara.com</a></h3>
            <p>This website is hard to look at. It's a clothing website for fashion designers, but everything feels very half-hazardously placed and out of line. There are many different types of clothing for men, women, and kids, but it's hard to click on because it keeps jumping around. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast: The contrast is decent with the white menus and dark photos, but the text stands out.</li>
                <li>Repetition: This entire website has no repetition; I feel as if there are just random fonts, colors, and pictures everywhere; nothing is organized.</li>
                <li>Alignment: The alignment is weird; there is a nav bar, but it's on the left, and the search bar is just randomly placed; it doesn't fit overall; there is no alignment for elements.</li>
                <li>Proximity: There is a large amount of empty space everywhere on this page, and it doesn't feel well placed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This website does not follow CRAP principles. I can see that they tried to be different and have a stylized page, but overall it just looks bad.</p>
