       <p>I think this card is the old reliable. Its NVIDIA's version of the 1080 which is the most wildly popular NVIDIA card still to this day. The 1080 was a monster back in its day and this was the budget 1080. This card has served me so well I can only thank it for its service 10/10.</p>

       <p>This processor has never given me any problems right out of the box. I feel like it I never got to use its full potential because I had such a bottleneck of a GPU I would give it a 9/10. It still holds up today. </p>

     <p>This is my gaming laptop. I got it for christmas  before college and it other than a cracked screen which was my fault it has  been my goto when I want to game on the go. Its super helpful to have because even though it only has 3 hours of  batterylife that is still  plenty for all of my classes and I can play any game I need to 9/10. </p>
